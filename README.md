# Ng2 Material for Dart

This is a port of [justindujardin/ng2-material](https://github.com/justindujardin/ng2-material).

## How to contribute

If you plan to contribute by helping to port the components, let me know [here](https://github.com/adaojunior/md/issues/new) so we won't have duplicated work.
Since the original code was written in typescript, I used `ts2dart` to translate most of the code to Dart, you can find it [here](https://github.com/adaojunior/md/releases/tag/ts2dart),it may help you, but it is garanted that you'll have to make some changes since the code generated by ts2dart is far from perfect and has many bugs.
You must send a PR (eg: feat(MdButton)) with the component and the example for that component. You copy the code for basic usage [here](https://github.com/adaojunior/md/releases/tag/ts2dart).
All the CSS and Html for the components and examples are ready, you only have to fix the issues with the generated ts2dart code.
